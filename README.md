# RESISTANCE_FREQUENCY_NUMBER

## RESISTANCE OF A NUMBER



The strength of a number is obtained by multiplying all the digits that compose it.
As with many sequences, multiplicative persistence (MP) is sequence that best explained by example.

The MP of 35 is 1 because: 3 × 5 = 15, 1 × 5 = 5
The MP of 55 is 2 because: 5 × 5 = 25, 2 × 5 = 10, 1 × 0 = 0

Naturally, mathematicians saw this pattern and challenged one another to find a number with the highest MP. So far, the longest sequence an MP of 11:

277777788888899 → 4996238671872 → 438939648 → 4478976 → 338688 → 27648 → 2688 → 768 → 336 → 54 → 20 → 0



## Count Frequency of an Array


Count the Frequency of numbers in an integer Array. Like:
In the integer array [5,2,1,5,2,3,4,2,8,6,5,2,5,2] the number 5 occurs 4 times. So we say that 5 has a "frequency" of 4.

In the same array the most frequent number is 2 (with a frequency of 5). The second most frequent number is 5 (with a frequency of 4).
